### HW01-DeepLearning

In order to run the codes just simply open them through Google colab and run (Unfortunately GitHub does not show the headers).

Google Colab links to the notebooks:

[1.1_Simulation_F1.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sadeghitabas/CPSC8430-DeepLearning/blob/master/1.1_Simulation_F1.ipynb)

[1.2_Simulation_F2.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sadeghitabas/CPSC8430-DeepLearning/blob/master/1.2_Simulation_F2.ipynb)
